    <p class="title"><strong>United Kingdom</strong></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> Currently, the UK has: </p>
    <ul>
    <li > 5,923,820 confirmed cases, according to the <a class="links" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/united-kingdom-covid-cases.html"> New York Times </a> </li>
    <li>129,881 deaths</li>
    <li>68.5-78.9% of people vaccinated across all 4 countries in the UK</li>
    <li>While the UK did completely reopen its economy 2 weeks ago, as the Delta variant COVID-19 cases were skyrocketing, its number of reported cases has fallen steeply. After a peak of 54674 on July 17, new daily cases reached half of that on August 2.
</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><u>So far, the UK has been doing very well on vaccination rates.</u>The Office for National Statistics estimates that around <b>92% of the English population has antibodies through vaccination or through previous infection</b>. However, it’s important to note that some experts, such as genetic epidemiology professor Tim Spector from King’s College London, are accounting the low number of cases due to a lack of young people getting tested and asymptomatic cases not being counted. However, John Edmunds (from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies Committee) refutes this statement, stating that the <b>end of the Euro 2020 championships </b> and the start of school vacations has caused the low amount of cases.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the UK’s implementation of <b>apps to help citizens recognize when they’ve been in contact with someone</b> has been infected has played a tremendous amount into reducing the amount of cases, causing citizens to self-isolate at home.
 </p>
    <p> While the UK is doing well on COVID-19 right now, in the beginning, the government did struggle to respond to the onslaught of cases.

    <p class = "header2"><strong>Problems Faced During the Pandemic</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheader1"><u>Caring for Seniors</u></p>
 <br>
    <p>At the beginning of the pandemic, the UK government more so focused on the National Health Society. When the Care Providers Association asked the Department of Health and Social Care about specific action to take back in January 2020, the DHSC stated there was nothing to advise on. In February, they recommended that there be no blocks on visits and no face masks worn, under the impression that very few residents would be infected. But over the next 3 months, 40% of care homes in England were hit with the virus, with cases increasing from 33 to 793 by the end of March. 
</p>
  <p> By May, care homes in UK had accounted for almost as many deaths as hospitals. Efforts to lower the death rate at care homes took a longer time to play into effect than other countries like Hong Kong and Germany.</p>
    <p class="subheader1"><u>Access to PPE</u></p>
    <p> Back in April 2020, hospitals were starting to mandate hospital workers wearing bags over the faces in lieu of masks due to a shortage of PPE (masks, gown, and visors). While deliveries only consisted of 300 masks, staff used over 400 masks a day. At the worst point, from March 24 to April 13, the Wren Hall care home had no masks, gowns, or visors. Staff absences reached a high of 20%. Care workers began dying from COVID-19 at twice the rate of NHS officials.</p>
    <p> Fundraisers and policy changes helped to increase the number of PPE getting out to hospital workers, but their access to PPE greatly impeded patient care and exponentially increased danger to hospital and care workers. </p>
    <p> has also caused a reduction in the effectiveness of care centers and doctors, resulting in an increase in the death rate. </p>
