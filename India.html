    <p class="title"><strong>India</strong></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> Currently, India has: </p>
    <ul>
    <li > 31,856,757 confirmed cases, according to <a class="links" href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/"> worldometers.info </a> </li>
    <li>426,785 deaths</li>
    <li>10% of citizens fully vaccinated</li>
    <li>While cases of the Delta variant peaked at 400,000 daily infections in May, Delta cases have now dropped by a factor of 10 in India, baffling experts.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><u>Currently, COVID-19 cases are beginning to drop in India after a exponential high in May.</u></p>
    <p>On May 3, 2021, India reached a new high of daily cases: 357,229 diagnosed. </p>
    <p> One of the reasons for this was because of <b> Prime Minister Nanrenda Modi’s strict 21-day national lockdown </b>, which was proactive but rushed. India’s 1.39 billion people were forced to migrate at rates not seen since the Partition of India in 1947, with millions of workers hurrying to their homes. Thousands of these migrants died from traveling - not only from the virus, through traffic accidents, starvation, and police heavily enforcing the lockdown rules. An attempt to remediate a catastrophe cascaded into another. </p>
    <p> Additionally, while Modi was very closely involved with the Serum Institute of India’s efforts to produce the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, he <b> did not order vaccines until January 2021 </b>, when most of Serum’s stock had went to the UK and Canada. India was only able to purchase 5.5 million vaccines for India’s 1.3 billion citizens. </p>
    <p>India also <b> exported many vital resources </b> - twice as much oxygen as in 2020, 1.1 million units of remdesivir, 50 million hydroxychloroquine tablets, and 66 million vaccine doses. </p>
    <p> Modi was also accused of <b> <i> undercounting cases </b> </i>. On October 20, he was quoted as stating there were 83 deaths out of every million citizens. However, Dr. Arun Njanappily Madhavan published a spreadsheet showing discrepancies between official death figures and numbers he and other volunteers had collected, noting that over 60-70% of deaths were not counted in Kerala itself. This undercounting caused people to take the pandemic in a looser manner. </p>
    <p> India also continued to hold large gatherings of festivals and tourism. Tourists came from all over the world to celebrate Christmas and New Year’s at Goa, and Modi mandated the celebration of the Kumbh Mela festival, which became the world’s largest superspreader event. </p>
    <br>
    <p class = "header2"><strong>Problems That Have Stemmed From the Pandemic:</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheader1"><u>Overwhelmed Healthcare System</u></p>
 <br>
    <p>India’s high numbers of COVID-19 cases has led to an overwhelming of current healthcare infrastructure, with most hospitals reaching capacity and not having enough beds, oxygens, and doctors to take in more patients. Some patients lie outside the hospitals, while others share beds.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheader1"><u>Lack of PPE</u></p>
    <p> 
    <br>
    <p> Doctors do not have enough PPE, making the virus spread at increasing rates in hospitals and care homes. The direct interaction of hospital workers with patients has made it so that it is nearly impossible to prevent infection. </p>
    <p> has also caused a reduction in the effectiveness of care centers and doctors, resulting in an increase in the death rate. </p>
    <br>  
    <p class="subheader1"><u>Insufficient Testing</u></p>
    <br>
    <p>  At this point, more bodies are being cremated than the number of death cases being reported by the government. This indicates that the number of infections and deaths is higher than what is being reported. The situation is far worse than the numbers let on. </p>
