    <li >6,851,910 total cases</li>
    <li>173,777 deaths</li>
    <li>Delta variant has spiked Covid-19 deaths in Africa by 80% in one month (stated by World Health Organization) </li>
    <li>Delta variant, which is currently the most transmissible of all variants, has been detected in 21 African countries, while the Alpha variant is in 35 countries and Beta in 30</li>
     <li>Only 18 million people in Africa are fully vaccinated, representing 1.5% of the continent’s population compared with over 50% in some high-income countries</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>
    <p>At least six countries in Africa are facing shortages of intensive care unit beds, as well as the demand for medical oxygen has spiked and is now estimated to be 50% higher than at the same time in 2020, yet supply has not kept up. The double barrier of vaccine scarcity and treatment challenges is seriously undermining effective response to the surging pandemic.</p>

    <p class = "header2"><strong>Problems That Have Stemmed From the Pandemic:</strong></p>
    <br>

    <p class="subheader1"><u>Vaccination</u></p>
 <br>

    <p>With new and faster spreading coronavirus variants such as Delta spreading to more and more countries, being vaccinated is cruical to avoid transmitting them. For Africa, less than 2% of the continent has been fully vaccinated, therefore many people dying cause they're unvaccinated. Authorities in many African countries don't have full/correct documentation of people’s locations, ages, and up to date information such as people's existing conditions,or the resources to list them all in advance. For these reasons and to avoid wasting vaccines, a proportion of the doses have been used to vaccinate people not in the highest priority groups in a number of African countries.</p>

    <br>
<p class="subheader2"><u>Testing</u></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Africa is one of the lowest testing rates in the world</li>
    <li>At the beginning of the pandemic, the continent had only two testing laboratories to carry out training and testing for other countries: one in Senegal and the other in South Africa. Since then, the number has increased to over 44 dedicated COVID-19 testing laboratories, but the ability of a country to test for COVID-19 is strongly related to its income level. Since some of the African countries are amongst the poorest in the world, they have the lowest testing rates per 1,000 people</li>
