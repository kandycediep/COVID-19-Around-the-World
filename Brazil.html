    <ul>
    <li >19,953,501 confirmed cases (stated by World Health Organization)</li>
    <li>557,223 deaths</li>
    <li>Only about 20% of the population has been fully vaccinated </li>
    <li>New Delta variant makes up 45% of the new covid cases in Rio (A city in Brazil)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>
    <p><u>Brazil's high numbers are a result of President Jair Bolsonaro' treament of Covid.</u></p>
    <br>
    <p>Bolsonaro refused to buy covid vaccines, treated COVID-19 as "a little flu", and did not order lockdowns. He finally gave in to the vaccinations in March 2021 as the COVID-19 cases started to surge. However, the government's inablity to recognize the severity of COVID led to more disasters. Brazil's government had no set plan to counter this virus. In fact, The Ministry of Health promoted using hydroxychloroquine which was a drug that the majority proved to be ineffective towards COVID. This slowed down the distribution of vaccines. Additionally, the government struggled in importing equiment such as Covid tests, syringes, and needles for vaccines. </p>
  <br>
    <p><strong>Despite this, Brazil is reopening.</strong></p>

    <p class = "header2"><strong>Problems That Have Stemmed From the Pandemic:</strong></p>
    <br>

    <p class="subheader1"><u>Poverty</u></p>
 <br>

    <p>The pandemic has given a rise to poverty. Millions of people have lost their income and homes. In order to counter this, the government introduced monthly emergency payments. This handout started off at 600 reais($107) but was cut in half. Despite these handouts, citizens are barely making it past each month. Unable to accommodate for house expensives, citizens have seeked refuge at informal settlements that have been made throughout the pandemic. However, the govenment have been evicting communities from these settlements.</p>
      <ul>
     <li>On July 1st, the police evicted members from the "First of May Refugee Camp". This community consisted of 3,000 	people.</li>
   </ul>  

    <br>
<p class="subheader2"><u>Food Shortage</u></p>
  <ul>
    <li>117 million people, 55% of Brazil's population faced food insecurity in 2020 August.</li>
  </ul>  
  <br>
<p class="subheader2"><u>Hospital Closures</u></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hospitals in 15 states in Brazil have reached over 90% bed occupancy.</li>
	  <li>Hospital are running out of incubation kits and oxygen</li> 
      <ul>
        <li>These incubation kits include anesthetics, sedatives, and etc.</li>
      </ul>
